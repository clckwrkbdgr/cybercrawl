you feel a pull downward - scroll of gold detection, but no gold on
	current level
your [weapon] glows blue for a moment - scroll of enchant weapon
you feel a strange sense of loss - scroll of enchant [weapon or armor] but
	you aren't [wearing any or wielding one]
you hear a maniacal laughter in the distance - you read a scroll of scare
	monster, which invalidates the scroll
as you pick up the scroll it turns to dust - you tried to retrieve a
	scroll of scare monster
you feel as if someone is watching over you - scroll of remove curses
you hear a high pitched humming noise - scroll of aggravate monster
this scroll seems to be blank - you read a NOP scroll
you have been granted the boon of genocide - lucky you!
wait, what's going on here... - potion of confusion
you feel very sick - potion of poison
you feel momentarily sick - potion of poison, but you're wearing a ring
	of retain strength
you feel better - potion of healing (also restores sight if blind)
you begin to sense the presence of monsters - potion of monster detection
you sense the presence of magic on this level - potion of magic detection
you have a strange feeling for a moment, then it passes - potion of
	[monster or magic] detection, but none remaining on this level
you can't move - potion of paralysis
this potion tastes like [fruit] juice - potion of see invisible
you suddenly feel much more skillful - potion of raise skill (experience)

hey, this tastes great... - potion of restore strength
a cloak of darkness falls around you - potion of blindness (uh-oh)
this potion tastes extremely dull - NOP potion
what a bizzare schtick - you just zapped with a do nothing stick
you have a tingling feeling - you just zapped with a staff of drain life,
	but there were no monsters to drain life from
you are too weak to use it - you tried to zap with a staff of drain life but
	you don't have enough hit points left (you must have 2 or more)
*** A staff of drain life works by reducing YOUR hit points in half, and ***
*** taking the same amount, divided evenly, from all the monsters in the ***
*** room. So it's best to use the drain life staff in a room with only   ***
*** one monster, or better yet, in a hallway, to get most effectiveness. ***

When zapping with an unknown stick (generic term for staff, wand, rod), you
may get any of the following responses:

nothing happens - your stick is all used up

" " (no response) - any of the following may be true:
	staff of haste monster
	staff of slow monster
	staff of polymorph (but a monster will change to another monster)
	staff of teleport away (but the monster disappears, temporarily)
	staff of teleport to (but now you're next to the monster (!))
	staff of cancellation  This removes a monster's ability to do any
		of its evil magic on you. The following monsters are thusly
		affected:

		Rust Monsters 	cannot ruin your armor
		Floating Eyes	cannot tranfix you
		Giant Ants	cannot sting you
		Wraiths		cannot drain your energy
		Violet Fungi	cannot hold you
		Leperchauns	cannot steal your gold
		Nymphs		cannot steal your magic items

		But apparently Umber Hulks can still confuse you.

/*
List of "unrandom" artefacts. Not the same as "fixed" artefacts, which are
completely hardcoded (eg Singing Sword, Wrath of Trog).
 note: the order of the list doesn't matter
Because the list numbering starts at 1, the last entry is the highest value
which can be given to NO_UNRANDARTS (eg if the list consists of randarts no
1, 2 or 3, NO_UNRANDARTS must be set to 3 or lower, but probably not to 0).
Setting it higher could cause nasty problems.

Okay, so the steps to adding a new unrandart go as follows:
1) - Fill in a new entry below, using the following guidelines:
true name: The name which is displayed when the item is id'd
un-id'd name: obvious
class: weapon, armour etc
type: long sword, plate mail etc. Jewellery unrandarts have the powers of
	  their base types in addition to anything else.
plus: For weapons, plus to-hit. For armour, plus. For jewellery, irrelevant.
	  But add 100 to make the item stickycursed. Note that the values for
      wpns and armr are +50.
plus2: For wpns, plus to-dam. Curses are irrelevant here. Mostly unused
	  for armr and totally for rings. Armour: if boots, plus2 == 1 means
      naga barding; 2 means centaur barding. If headgear, 1 means helmet,
      2 means helm, 3 means cap, 4 means wizard's hat.
colour: Obvious. Don't use BLACK, use DARKGREY instead.

* Note * any exact combination of class, type, plus & plus2 must be unique,
 so (for example) you can't have two +5, +5 long swords in the list. Curses
 don't count for this.

brand: Weapons only. Have a look in enum.h for a list, and look in fight.cc
	  and describe.cc for the effects.
      Range of possible values: see enum.h
+/- to AC, ev, str, int, dex - These are pretty obvious. Be careful - a player
	  with a negative str, int or dex dies instantly, so avoid high penalties
      to these stats.
      Range: any, but be careful.

res fire, res cold: Resists. Can be above 1; multiple sources of fire or cold
	  resist *are* cumulative. Can also be -1 (but probably not -2 or below)
      for susceptibility.
      Range: -1 to about 5, after which you'll become almost immune.
res elec: Resist electricity. Unlike fire and cold, resist electricity
	  reduces electrical damage to 0. This makes multiple resists irrelevant.
      Also is no susceptibility, so don't use -1.
      Range: 0 or 1.
res poison: same as res electricity.
	  Range: 0 or 1.
life prot: Stops energy draining and negative energy attacks. Not cumulative,
	  and no susceptibility here either.
      Range: 0 or 1.
res magic: This is cumulative, but no susceptibility. To be meaningful, should
	  be set to about 30 - 50.
      Range: 0 to MAXINT probably, but about 100 is a realistic ceiling.

see invis: Lets you see invisible things, but not submerged water beasts.
	  Range: 0 or 1.
turn invis: Gives you the ability to turn invisible using the 'a' menu.
levitate, blink, go berserk, sense surroundings: like turn invis.
	  Ranges for all these: 0 or 1.

make noise: Irritate nearby creatures and disrupts rest. Weapons only.
	  Range: 1 - 4, for different types of noises (see special_wielded() in
      it_use3.cc); 0 for none.
no spells: Prevents any spellcasting (but not scrolls or wands etc)
	  Range: 0 or 1.
teleport: Every now and then randomly teleports you. *Really* annoying.
	  Weapons only.
	  Range: 0 to about 15 (higher means more teleporting).
no teleport: Prevents the player from teleporting, except rarely when they're
	  forced to (eg banished to the Abyss).
      Range: 0 or 1.

force berserk: Every time you attack, you go berserk. Weapons only.
	  Range: 0 or 1.
speed metabolism: Makes you consume food faster. No effect on mummies.
	  Range: 0 to about 4. 4 would be horrible; 1 is annoying but tolerable.
mutate: makes you mutate, sometimes after a long delay. No effect on some
	  races (espec undead).
      Range: 0 to about 4.
+/- to-hit/to-dam: Obvious. Affects both melee and missile. Should be left
	  at 0 for weapons, which get +s normally.

Some currently unused properties follow, then:

First string: is appended to the unrandart's 'V' description.

Second string: replaces the thing at the start of a 'V' description.
If empty, uses the description of the unrandart's base type. Note: the
base type of a piece of unrandart jewellery is relevant to its function, so
don't obscure it unnecessarily.

Then another unused string.

2) - Add one to the #define NO_UNRANDARTS line in randart.h

3) - Maybe increase the probability of an unrandart of the appropriate
 type being created; look in dungeon.cc for this (search for "unrand").
 Forget this step if you don't understand it; it's of very little importance.

Done! Now recompile and wait years for it to turn up.

Note: changing NO_UNRANDARTS probably makes savefiles incompatible.
